### Healthy competition or cold war?

Internet is like a blanket today. Each startup pulls it off to take bigger bite.
Large internet companies often create unnecessary barriers between own users and users of
competing web-sites. Shortly we can expect generation that haven't
seen anything at all, except for Facebook.

### Coect is freedom

The word _coect_ is made up of two words, **co**act and conn**ect**. It means
that we need to **coact to connect with each other**.

Coect is the **freedom of communication**. Open protocol integrates Email, XMPP,
RSS, VoIP-telephony, video conferencing, data transmition in P2P mode, and the
typical features of social networks (users can follow each other, broadcast,
comment, repost, etc). Coect protocol provides addressing, discovery,
authentication and transmission of any data between any devices connected to the
Internet: computers, smartphones, wearable and home sensors.

Coect is **freedom for developers**. Any company can build a service using
protocol Coect, and interact with other companies without limitations. Right now
we exchange emails without thinking about what kind of server, the provider or
the client uses the recipient of the message. Coect adheres the same approach.

Coect is **freedom for the users**. Anyone can use their domain name as username
in Coect. Also you can get the address on a shared server like Gmail. You can
change your Coect-provider anytime and keep your address and contacts. All
communication between users can be encrypted.


### Universal address for everything

For different types of communication (phone, email, social news) with one person
we need to use different addresses. However using of new address for each
channel of communication is inconvenient and wrong. Coect offers a single
address for everything.

The same address can be used for phone calls, text messaging, video
conferencing, and reading the news in social networks. The universal
address can be used by different applications. Universal does not mean one
address per person. To communicate at work, you can use one universal address,
for communicating with friends &mdash; the other.


### The computer is dead. Long live the smartphone!

The world of technology is changing so rapidly, that not everyone knows what is
[desktop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer), a symbol of the era of [PC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer). Smartphones and tablets have outstripped
desktops by the number of units sold
[2 years ago](http://www.asymco.com/2012/01/17/the-rise-and-fall-of-personal-computing/).
The data of [this year](http://www.kpcb.com/insights/2013-internet-trends) show
that the share of mobile customers continues to grow steadily. Wearable Internet
devices become a part of everyday life. Homes are filled with smart sensors.
We stand on the threshold of
[Internet of Things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things).

All these diverse network nodes should exchange information and hence use a
standard understood by all protocol. It is here that we see a market niche and
primary goal for Coect: **teach all Internet-connected devices to speak the
same language and understand each other**.
