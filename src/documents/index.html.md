### Healthy competition or cold war?

The Internet feels like a quilt today. Every startup tries to pull it their way
to take the bigger bite. Large internet companies often create unnecessary
barriers between their own users and users of competing web sites. Shortly we
can expect a generation that haven't seen anything at all, except for Facebook.

### Coect is freedom

The word _coect_ is made up of two words, **co**act and conn**ect**. It means
that we need to **coact to connect with each other**.

Coect is the **freedom of communication**. Open protocol integrates Email, XMPP,
RSS, VoIP-telephony, video conferencing, data transmition in P2P mode, and the
typical features of social networks (users can follow each other, broadcast,
comment, repost, etc). Coect protocol provides addressing, discovery,
authentication and transmission of any data between any devices connected to the
Internet: computers, smartphones, wearable and home sensors.

Coect is **freedom for developers**. Any company can build a service using
protocol Coect, and interact with other companies without limitations. Right now
we exchange emails without thinking about what kind of server, Internet provider or
email client the recipient of the message has. Coect adheres to the same
approach.

Coect is **freedom for the users**. Anyone can use their domain name as username
in Coect. You can even use a free address on a shared server like Gmail. You can
change your Coect-provider anytime and keep your address and contacts. All
communication between users can be encrypted.


### Universal address for everything

Today, we have to use different addresses for the same person based on type of
communication: phone, email, social news &mdash; we believe that this is inconvenient
and plain wrong. Coect offers a single address for everything.

The same address can be used for phone calls, text messaging, video
conferencing, and reading the news in social networks. The universal
address can be used by different applications. Universal does not mean the same
address per person. To communicate at work, you can use one universal address,
for communicating with friends &mdash; the other one.


### The computer is dead. Long live the smartphone!

The world of technology is changing so rapidly, that not everyone knows what is
[desktop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer), a symbol of the era of [PC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer). Smartphones and tablets have outstripped
desktops by the number of units sold
[2 years ago](http://www.asymco.com/2012/01/17/the-rise-and-fall-of-personal-computing/).
The data of [this year](http://www.kpcb.com/insights/2013-internet-trends) show
that the share of mobile customers continues to grow steadily. Wearable Internet
devices become a part of everyday life. Homes are filled with smart sensors.
We stand on the threshold of
[Internet of Things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things).

All these diverse network nodes should exchange information and hence use a
standard protocol that everybody understands. It is here that we see a market niche and
primary goal for Coect: **teach all Internet-connected devices to speak the
same language and understand each other**.
