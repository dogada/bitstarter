### Healthy competition or cold war?

The Internet feels like a quilt today. Every startup tries to pull it their way
to take the bigger bite. Large internet companies often create unnecessary
barriers between their own users and users of competing web sites. Shortly we
can expect a generation that haven't seen anything at all, except for Facebook.


### Cooperation instead of destruction

The word _coect_ is made up of two words, **co**act and conn**ect**. It means
that we need to **coact to connect with each other**.

Coect project offers an alternative to the monopoly &mdash; [free
communication protocol](/protocol/). Coect is hundreds of national,
corporate and niche social networks that allow users to interact directly with
each other. Using Coect you can chat with users of other social networks as easy
as now you exchange email with any recipients.


### Universal address for everything

Today, we have to use different addresses for the same person based on type of
communication: phone, email, social news &mdash; we believe that this is inconvenient
and plain wrong. Coect offers a universal address for everything.

The same address can be used for phone calls, text messaging, video
conferencing, and reading the news in social networks. Universal does not mean
single address per person. To communicate at work, you can use one universal
address, for communicating with friends &mdash; the other one.


### The computer is dead. Long live the smartphone!

The world of technology is changing so rapidly, that not everyone knows what is
[desktop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer), a symbol of the era of [PC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer). Smartphones and tablets have outstripped
desktops by the number of units sold
[2 years ago](http://www.asymco.com/2012/01/17/the-rise-and-fall-of-personal-computing/).
The data of [this year](http://www.kpcb.com/insights/2013-internet-trends) show
that the share of mobile customers continues to grow steadily. Wearable Internet
devices become a part of everyday life. Homes are filled with smart sensors.
We stand on the threshold of
[Internet of Things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things).

All these diverse network nodes should exchange information and hence use a
standard protocol that everybody understands. It is here that we see a market niche and
primary goal for Coect: **teach all Internet-connected devices to speak the
same language and understand each other**.
