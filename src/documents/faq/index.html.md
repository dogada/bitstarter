### What is Coect?

Coect is free decentralized technology that can replace Email, XMPP and
social networks. Coect is based on open protocol.


### What is the meaning of the word _coect_?

The word _coect_ is made up of two words, **co**act and conn**ect**. It means
that we need to **coact to connect with each other**.


### What is the Coect mission?

Teach all Internet-connected devices to speak the same language and understand each other.


### How can you compete with billion dollar companies that have millions of users?

There is well-known Wall Street adage: &laquo;No tree grows to the sky&raquo;.
Coect doesn't want to become another relict tree in the forest. Our goal is to
become the new land on which other people will beat the orchards. A tree sooner
or later falls, the land is always in place. This is philosophical part of our
plan. From a business perspective, we plan to make money by selling shovels to
the gardeners.
