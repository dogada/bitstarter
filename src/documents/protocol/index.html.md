### The evolution of Email and XMPP (Jabber)

We love decentralized nature of Email and XMPP, but, unfortunately, these
technologies do not meet today's challenges. In Coect we intend to take all best
that is in these technologies, and add missed parts.

### When will be available the final version of the protocol?

Such complex protocols like Coect, can not be born immediately. At first need to
create a working version of the prototype, test it in the real world, then
collect  users opinios and expert advices, and only then we can start to think
about final version of protocol.

At the moment we're working on the implementation of Coect prototype. Subscribe
