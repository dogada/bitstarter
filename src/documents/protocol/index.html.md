### The evolution of Email and XMPP (Jabber)

We love decentralized nature of Email and XMPP, but, unfortunately, these
technologies do not meet today's challenges. In Coect we intend to take all best
that we have in these technologies, and add missed parts.

### When the final version of the protocol will be available?

Such complex protocols like Coect, can not be born immediately. At the first we
plan to create a working version of the prototype to test it in the real world,
then collect users opinions and expert advices, and only then we can start to
think about the final version of protocol.

At the moment we're working on the implementation of Coect prototype. Subscribe
